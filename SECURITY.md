# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As a rule of thumb, check the major number of the current release.
Any major number less than that should be considered unsupported *unless* there is an incentive to support it (such as high(er) popularity/use).

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.0   | :x:                |

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a critical project that depends on a vulnerable, unsupported version such that you cannot upgrade,
> please contact me so that we can make arrangements to provide a patch. However, this will not be free of charge.
